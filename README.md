# Number-Converter
Tiny Unity Program that can convert from 10-base numbers to other number systems: 2-36-bases available. Gamified slightly. 

    To test out the code,
      1. create a new unity project (I believe this will work with any version)
      2. copy content of github repo to Asset folder
      3. Scene\SampleScene.unity is the functional setup.
      
      IntegerToNBaseNumberConverter is the class doing conversions.
